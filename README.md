The [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

This project was a tutorial by [Stephane Beniak](https://tutsplus.com/authors/stephane-beniak) found at [Creating Life: Conway's Game of Life](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/creating-life-conways-game-of-life--gamedev-558)

Its a simple two-dimensional grid of cells, some cells are on and some are off, there is a set of rules that govern when they turn on or turn off which results in some interesting cell like behavior.
